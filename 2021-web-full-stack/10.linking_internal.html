            It was simple, but again, let's consider another situation when you want to write Hello, World! a thousand times. We can certainly not write printf() statements a thousand times. Almost all the programming languages provide a concept called loop, which helps in executing one or more statements up to a desired number of times. All high-level programming languages provide various forms of loops, which can be used to execute one or more statements repeatedly.
        </dd>

        <dd>
            After executing all the statements given in the loop body, the computer goes back to while( i lt 5) and the given condition, (i lt 5), is checked again, and the loop is executed again if the condition holds true. This process repeats till the given condition remains true which means variable has a value less than 5.
