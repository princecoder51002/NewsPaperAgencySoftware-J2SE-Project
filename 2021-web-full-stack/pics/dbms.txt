
DATA BASE MANAGEMENT SYSTEM

IT IS DIVIDED INTO TWO PARTS

1. BY CLICK

STEPS: 1.CLICK TO NEW
       2. CREATE DATABASE(2021-WEB)
       3. SPACE IS NOT ALLOWED WHILE TYPING
       4. CREATE A TABLE AMD GIVE A NAME TO IT
       5. EXAMPLE :- index(primary key)->value cant be repeated thats why primary is used
                     sname(varchar)->length(30)
                     percentage(float)
                     branch(varchar)->length(10)
                     collegename(varchar)->length(50)
                     mobile(varchar)->length(10)
       6. TO INSERT RECORDS (USING INSERT TABLE)->THEN INPUT->THEN CLICK GO
       7. STRUCTURE IS USED FOR ADDING NEW FEILDS 
       8. WE CAN ALSO EDIT AND ADD NEW ROWS AND COLUMNS ALSO
 

2.  BY WRITING QUERIES

STEPS: 1. GO TO MYSQL
       create table trainees (rollno int primary key, tname varchar(20), per float, branch varchar(10), mobile varchar(12) )

       2.//Full Insertion
         insert into trainees values (101, 'Aman', 77.88,'cse','65656575')

       3.//Partial Insertion
         insert into trainees(rollno,tname,mobile) values(103, 'Raman', '65656575')
       4.//updation
       update trainees set per=81.21,branch='cse' where rollno=103
       update trainees set per=per+5 WHERE per<94

       5.//to delete all records
         delete from trainees

       6.//delete a record
         delete from trainees where rollno=103

******************retrieval/Searching/fetching************************
       7.//Fetching all records
         select * from trainees

         select * from trainees where branch='cse'
         select * from trainees where tname='Aman' and branch='cse'
         SELECT tname,rollno FROM `trainees` where branch='cse'

       8.//for unique values in a column
         select distinct branch from trainees
         select max(per) from trainees
         select max(per) as 'Highest' from trainees where branch='cse'
       9.//Nested Queries
          select * from trainees where per=(select max(per) as 'Highest' from trainees where branch='cse')

          select avg(per) as 'Avg', min(per) as 'Min', max(per) as 'Maximum' from trainees 

**************************************************************************

      10.// for searching in  ascending order 
         select * from employee order by ename

      11.// for searching in descending order
         select * from employee order by ename desc

      12.// for searching top 2 employee having maximum salary
         select * from employee order by total desc limit 2

      13.// for searching the employee having maximum salary except who is having highest (limit 1,2----> 1 is used for leaving top)
         select * from employee order by total desc limit 1,2
        
      14.// for searching whose name starts with m
         select * from employees where ename like 'm%'

      15.// for searching whose name contains m
      select * from employees where ename like '%m%'
      
      16.// for searching a name having 4 letters
         select * from employees where ename like '____'

      17. // for searching a name ends with m
          select * from employees where ename like '%m'

      18.// for searching a name having m on 3rd position
         select * from employees where ename like '__m%'

      19.// for current date and time
         create table library (book varchar(20), doi date,dor date, toi time)
         insert into library values('real java', CURRENT_DATE(), Date_add(current_date(), interval 5 day) ,CURRENT_TIME())

      20.// to check the difference between date of issue and date of return
         SELECT datediff(dor,doi) as 'diff in days' from library
